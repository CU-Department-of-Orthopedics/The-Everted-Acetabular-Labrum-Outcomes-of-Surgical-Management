Abstract

Background: An everted acetabular labrum (EL) is a pathologic variant in which the labrum is flipped to the capsular side of the acetabular rim. An iatrogenic EL is a known complication of a poorly executed labral repair, and a recent study described the native acetabular EL.

Purpose: To analyze surgical outcomes after advancement or reconstruction of an EL in a native hip.

Study design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods: This was a multicenter retrospective review of prospectively collected data on primary hip arthroscopic surgeries performed between 2013 and 2023. An EL was identified arthroscopically as a labrum-femoral head gap while off traction in the native hip. All patients with EL who were analyzed in this study underwent arthroscopic labral repair and advancement or labral augmentation or reconstruction. Patients with hip dysplasia also underwent periacetabular osteotomy with or without a derotational femoral osteotomy. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed using the 12-item International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-12) and the Nonarthritic Hip Score. PROs were obtained preoperatively and up to 24 months after surgery. PROs were compared with those of a case-matched control cohort in a 1:2 ratio. Only patients with PROs available at ≥1 year postoperatively were included in the outcome analysis.

Results: A total of 111 patients (129 hips) with EL during the study period were identified, with PROs available in 96 hips. The mean age of patients with EL was 30.5 years, and women made up 87% of the cohort. Of the 129 hips with an EL, an isolated diagnosis of an EL was present in 11.6% of hips. Deficient acetabular coverage (lateral center-edge angle <25°) was seen in 40.6% of EL hips. No difference was seen in iHOT-12 scores between EL and control groups at 12- or 24-month follow-up (P = .18 and .94, respectively). Patients with EL reported a significant improvement of PROs at latest follow-up (P < .001 for iHOT-12 and Nonarthritic Hip Score).

Conclusion: Surgical management of a native EL with restoration of the labral seal on the femoral head and correction of concomitant pathologies resulted in significant clinical improvement, with postoperative outcome scores comparable to those of patients without an EL. These findings provide evidence supporting surgical intervention for a native EL.
